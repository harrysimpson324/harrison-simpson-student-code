	Attributes for randomly generating customers		Difficulty -  difficult customers are hard to deal with. Customers with high difficulty are more likely to take up you time running food, getting drinks, and complaining. Also increases threshold that much be reached to successfully sell them a policy.		Penny Pincher - Customers with high penny pincher stat tip less and are less likely to buy expensive policies due to sticker shock.		Chattiness - Chattiness is a customers willingness to talk to you. Low chattiness wont give you the time of day. High chattiness will talk a lot, even if they are not buying.		Gullibleness - Customers with high gullibleness can't recognize a bad deal. More likely to believe scenarios presented to them.		Anxiousness - How likely a negative scenario is to make them buy insurance. If low, logical arguments work better. If high, emotional arguments work better.
