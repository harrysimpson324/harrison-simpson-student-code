-- CONCATENATING OUTPUTS

-- All city names and their state abbreviation.
-- Note surrounding "()" on state abbreviation.
-- Note the implied default ASC in ORDER BY. In general practice, only DESC is typically specified in the
--   SQL as needed.
-- Note building strings is typically not done within the SQL. Normally, the raw values are returned, and
--   concatenating is done within the application code that requested the data from the database.
SELECT (city_name + ' (' + state_abbreviation + ')') AS city_state_abbreviation
    FROM city
    ORDER BY city_name;

-- All park names and area
-- Note "Name: " and " Area: " in the concatenated string
SELECT ('Name: ' + park_name + ' Area: ' + area) as park_area
    FROM park
    ORDER BY park_name;

-- The census region and state name of all states in the West & Midwest sorted in ascending order.
-- Note colon-space between census region and state -- "census_region: state"
-- (optional) Note alternative ORDER BY, discuss why just the column names in the ORDER BY still returns
--   the same results as using the region_and_state concatenated string alias.
SELECT (census_region + ': ' + state_name) AS region_and_state
    FROM state
    WHERE census_region LIKE '%west'
    ORDER BY region_and_state;

-- SUBQUERIES

-- Subqueries aren't limited to WHERE clauses, can appear in SELECT list (must return only 1 result)
-- Include state name rather than the state abbreviation while counting the number of cities in each state,
--   ordered from most cities to least.

-- AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS

-- Average population across all the states. Note the use of alias, common with aggregated values.

-- Total population in the West and South census regions
SELECT SUM(population) AS west_south_population

-- The number of cities with populations greater than 1 million
SELECT COUNT(population) AS big_cities_count

-- The number of state nicknames.
-- Note COUNT(*) is commonly used to specify a row count rather than counting a specific column.
-- Note difference in the counts. NULL state nicknames are ignored by COUNT(state_nickname).

-- The area of the smallest and largest parks.
-- Note SQL statements aren't limited to just one aggregate function at a time.
SELECT MIN(area) AS smallest, MAX(area) AS largest

-- GROUP BY

-- Count the number of cities in each state, ordered from most cities to least.
-- Note state_abbreviation can be included in SELECT because it's included in GROUP BY.

-- Determine the average park area depending upon whether parks allow camping or not.

-- Sum of the population of cities in each state ordered by state abbreviation.
SELECT state_abbreviation, SUM(population) as sum_city_population
