	cards offered to the user (ie cards with just a picture and a fact) aren't saved to the database until the user adds a caption and hits the save to collection

	We made it so it saved when pressed saved to collection even if it didn't have a caption was that no the right way?

	I dunno if the readMe was super clear on that

	Replying to "cards offered to the..."
	
	dont remember
09:42:20 From Harry Simpson to Everyone:
	Replying to "cards offered to the..."
	
	i think we didn't let it save unless it was captioned
09:42:26 From Harry Simpson to Everyone:
	Replying to "cards offered to the..."
	
	but I might be wrong
09:43:27 From Joon Slocum to Everyone:
	Replying to "cards offered to the..."
	
	it did have a notEmpty thing but we kinda ignored that by not putting @Valid for the save method but that was prob wrong
09:45:03 From Harry Simpson to Everyone:
	Replying to "cards offered to the..."
	
	idk about wrong but yeah now that you say that I think they also added some front end stuff for when captions weren't added, like if you try to save with no caption the catcard website/client/whatever says, "must have caption to save" or something like that

	I think we saved the card even without the caption as well but just included an empty string "" in the method so that it would work
