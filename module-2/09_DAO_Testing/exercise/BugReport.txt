Bug 1
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
getTimesheetsByEmployeeId_with_valid_employee_id_returns_list_of_timesheets_for_employee()
in this method I assert that the method returns the correct number of timesheets by using assertEquals()

Expected output:
should be 3

Actual output:
1

How did you fix this bug?
Found that there was an if statement rather than a while loop in the method

Bug 2
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
in the getTimesheetsByProjectID with valid id test method:
Asserting that the method should return a list of size 3 and only getting a list of size 2

Expected output:
3
Actual output:
2
How did you fix this bug?
in the SQL query, in the WHERE clause, it still had employee_id in the search field.

Bug 3
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
updateTimesheet_updates_timesheet() method
assertTimesheetsMatch(updated, checkDatabase);
assertTimesheetsMatch(toUpdate, checkDatabase);
These fail because 'updated' is my holder for the method, toUpdate is what I pass into the method,
and both of those should match the database entry.

Expected output:
Billable should be true in all timesheets

Actual output:
billable was still false in the database

How did you fix this bug?
Added a billable assignment to the SQL query.


Bug 4
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
Assert.assertEquals("Method does not return correct value when isBillable = false", 0, time22, 0.001);

Expected output:
0

Actual output:
2.0

How did you fix this bug?
Added "AND billable = true;" to the end of the SQL query.
